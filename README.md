The Hangman Game is a simple yet engaging word-guessing game. Players guess letters to uncover a random word, trying to avoid running out of lives. Each wrong guess adds to the Hangman drawing, increasing the suspense. Fun ASCII art tracks your progress, creating an interactive experience.

This project is easy to run and uses Python's random module to pick words from a preset list. Clear prompts guide players, making it perfect for practicing Python or enjoying a quick game. Just run the script, follow the instructions, and guess wisely before the Hangman is complete!
